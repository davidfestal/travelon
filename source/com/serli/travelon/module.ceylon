"""## The Travelon visitor combinator framework
   
   This module provides a generic visitor combinators for Ceylon.
   It is a Ceylon port of the Java-based [JJTraveler project](https://github.com/cwi-swat/jjtraveler).
   Ceylon powerful generics implementation, as well as it high-order programmong support, allow providing 
   visitor combinators in a way that is quite easy to use.
   
   ## What are visitor combinators ?
   
   The notion of visitor combinators was first introduced in _Visitor Combination and Traversal Control_
   (Joost Visser, OOPSLA 2001).
   Visitor combinators are small, reusable classes that implement a _generic_ visitor interface.
   Here, _generic_ means: independent of any specific class hierarchy. Each combinator captures a basic 
   piece of functionality. They can be composed in different constellations to build more complex visitors.
   
   ## The Ceylon-specific implementation
    
    ... To be continued
   
   ## How to use :
   	
   Given the following class hierarchy :
   ```
   abstract class Node(String name) 
       of BinaryNode | Leaf {
       string => name;
   }
   class Leaf(String name)
       extends Node(name) {}
   class BinaryNode(String name, left, right) 
       extends Node(name) {
       shared Node left;
       shared Node right;
   }
   ```
   ... and the following object :
   ```
   value tree = BinaryNode("0", 
                    BinaryNode("1", 
                        Leaf("1.1"),
                        Leaf("1.2")),
                    BinaryNode("2", 
                        Leaf("2.1"),
                        Leaf("2.2")));
   ```
   The following visitor :
   ```
   value visitor = TopDown(Apply(void(Node n) => print(n)));
   ```
   can be applied on the tree :
   ```
   visitor.visit(tree);
   ```
   and will print :
   ```
   0
   1
   1.1
   1.2
   2
   2.1
   2.2
   ```
   
   You can apply the visitors to 2 kinds of objects :
     - Objects that implement the [[Visitable]] interface.
     - General-purpose objects. In this case, a [[Visitable]] is produced for each visited node through the [[Walker]] of the visitor. the default Walker is the [[MetaModelBasedWalker]]
     
   Other examples using nodes that satisfiy the [[Visitable]] interface can be found in the tests, or in the [[testVisitors]] method of this module.
   
   Additional walkers might be added in the future to accomodate specific trees, such as `ceylon.ast` trees, XML files, etc ...
